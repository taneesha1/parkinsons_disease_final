# Overview:

Parkinson's disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Today there stands no permanent solution for Parkinson’s disease. This project focuses on the detection of Parkinson's disease through various machine learning algorithms. The various algortihms used are logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, naive bayes and k-nearest neighbor.

# Key Features:
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

Best Performing Model: Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 93%, outperforming other models.

# Dataset: 

The dataset used is taken from Kaggle and has various medical parameters such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, sleep quality, and signs of Parkinson's (e.g., tremor, rigidity).

# Objective: 

To provide an efficient and accessible method for diagnosis, especially in rural areas where specialized healthcare professionals may not be available.

# Results:
- Random Forest: 93.36% accuracy.
-  Decision Tree: 89.57% accuracy.
- Logistic Regression: 80.09% accuracy.
- Naïve Bayes: 79.62% accuracy.
- K-nearest Neighbor	72.98% accuracy.
- The Random Forest Classifier proved to be the most effective model for this dataset, showing significant improvements in detecting patients with Parkinson's disease.

# Conclusion:
As cases of Parkinson’s Disease are expected to rise, early detection models like this can help ensure timely intervention, especially for underserved populations. This project aims to offer a viable solution for automated diagnosis using machine learning technologies
